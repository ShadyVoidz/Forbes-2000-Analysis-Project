# Forbes 2000 Analysis
# Project Description

As a part of my **Machine Learning Fundamentals Skill Path** from Codecademy, I have created this project to put together and improve on the skills I have learned by analyzing data from the "Forbes 2000 Global Companies" dataset I have collected from Kaggle(.com).

Currently I am using the programming language Python and will be using various libraries to further expand on my analysis (E.g. Pandas, matlibplot, and NumPy)
