# Forbes Global 2000 Analysis
---
## Project Description

As a part of my **Machine Learning Fundamentals Skill Path** from Codecademy, I have created this project to put together and improve on the skills I have learned through analyzing data from the "Forbes 2000 Global Companies" dataset I have collected from Kaggle.

Currently I am using the programming language Python and will be using various libraries to further expand on my analysis (E.g. Pandas, matplotlib.py, and NumPy)

## Project Goals ü•Ö

My main aim in this project is to put together all of the skills I have learnt from the Machine Learning Fundamentals Skill path and hopefully build upon/improve those skills. This project will allow me to help solidify my knowledge in areas such as "Exploratory Data Analysis".


#### Questions I plan to answer:

  1. What industries produced the most overall profits?
  2. Is there a correlation between a organizations profits and their employee count?
  3. What organization made the most amount of profits?
  4. Is there a correlation between an organizations origin country and profits?
  5. Is there a correlation between an organizations age and its profits?

## Concluding Results and Insights üîé

(It should be keep in mind that these findings are not absolute as there may of been other underlying factors that impacted these results, however, with the provided information these are the conclusions that I came to.)

  1. In the April 2021 - April 2022 financial year **banking** had the most amount of overall profits. Coming in with ~**$799,890,000,000** in profits.
  2. There is a pearson correlation of 0.3 indicating a **linear association**. This means that there are also other contributing factors affecting profits an organization makes.
  3. The "**Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco)**" had the most amount of profits out of all of the organizations listed in the dataset. They had generated a total of ~**$105,360,000,000** in profits!
  4. There is a noticable correlation between an organizations origin country and profits. For example, a organization created in the United states is more likely to produce higher profit margins than other      countries.
